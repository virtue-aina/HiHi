### Description

This project aims to create a spy-like encrypted chat application inspired by the technology from the series "Mr. and Mrs. Smith." The application will allow agents to communicate securely using end-to-end encryption. The backend will be developed using Java with Spring Boot, and the frontend will be built using TypeScript.

### Current State

- **Backend**: 
  - Basic structure with `User`, `Chat`, and `Message` classes.
  - Initial implementations for creating, deleting, and sending messages.
  - Basic REST endpoints and WebSocket configuration.

- **Frontend**:
  - Not yet implemented.

### Plans

1. **Backend**:
   - Complete the implementation of business logic in service classes.
   - Enhance security features, including end-to-end encryption.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Add more REST endpoints for additional functionalities.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Set up a TypeScript project with a modern framework (React.js or Angular).
   - Create user interfaces for chat functionalities.
   - Integrate with the backend using REST APIs and WebSocket for real-time communication.
   - Implement encryption and decryption of messages on the client side.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform.
